    <description>
Why choose Flow? Because other project management solutions are either too lean or waaaaay too complex...

Choose Flow when spreadsheets, whiteboards, and sticky notes just won’t do...

When apps like Todoist and Trello are too lean... Or when tools like Wrike, JIRA and Asana are overkill.
