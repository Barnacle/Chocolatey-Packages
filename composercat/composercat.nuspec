    <description>
Graphical interface for Composer (PHP). Now in beta!

Composercat will manage all your Composer configurations, update packages and even take care of updating Composer itself. No need to edit the composer.json file manually. Ever. 
* Packagist.org integration 
Composercat integrates seamlessly with packagist.org, which means you will always have up-to date information about your installed packages. 
* SSH support
Composercat will know how to connect to your virtual machine or remote server over SSH (coming soon).
