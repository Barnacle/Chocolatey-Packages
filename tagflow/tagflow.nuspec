    <summary>TagFlow improves your classification and simplifies the search for your files using an intelligent system with tags.</summary>
    <description>
## How does it work ?
TagFlow is a multiplatform application (compatible for Mac, Windows and Linux) that allows you to organize and find files on your computer through a system of smart tags. 

## Why using tags ?
You never know where to classify your documents, or what folder they are when you need them? You have documents copied to multiple storage and so many versions of the same file? All these problems are inherent in the system of classifications files that existed before the advent of computers !

The main problem with the files is that one can have only one access for each file: by browsing the folders until you reach the file. With tags, there is more order and it has several ways to get to the same file !
