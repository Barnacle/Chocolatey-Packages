    <summary>FileASSASSIN can eradicate any type of locked files from your computer.</summary>
    <description>If you use a computer, you've probably come across at least one of the following messages:
    Cannot delete file: Access is denied
    Make sure the disk is not full or write-protected and that the file is not currently in use
    The source or destination file may be in use
    The file is in use by another program or user
	These messages commonly appear when you're trying to delete files deposited by a malware infection, though occasionally a file just goes on lockdown. Whatever the reason for the file, FileASSASSIN can remove it
